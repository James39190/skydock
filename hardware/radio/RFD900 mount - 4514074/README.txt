RFD900 mount  by Coupe_ on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4514074

Summary:
Simple RFD900 mount with a 30mmx30mm mounting pattern, I used it to fit a RFD900X to my GEPRC Crocodile 7.Holes are suited for M3 fasteners and the standoffs can just be screwed into depending on the accuracy of the printer and settings used.
