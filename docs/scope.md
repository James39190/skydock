# SkyDock Scope
## The main obgecive is to lean how to make autonomously drones
- To fly at speeds greater than 40km/h at 1-2m on bumpy terrain 
- To us AI for object recognition and tracking on bord or esp and a laptop on esp-now or local
- Precision landing +- 40mm 
- Range in plane mode 6km 2m height
- To land recharge do a simulated spray refill then take off autonomously 

## approximate parameters
- 8-16GB ram 
- pi 5 with AI hat
- 3 mega pixels camera for ai 
- analog FPV cam 
- pixhawk 6x fc
- Wi-Fi upload no sd need 
- weight 1-2 kg
- wing span 1-2m (folds)
- 10 min hover 
- 50min fly to 40km/h
- track a ground body at 40km/h with a lazer  +- 70mm over a 110 dgr area = 11 dgr per sec
